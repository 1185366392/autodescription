AutoDescription makes sure your SEO is always up-to-date without any configuration needed.

== Description ==

= AutoDescription =

This plugin makes sure your site uses Description, Open Graph, LD+JSON, robots and a Canonical tag.

No configuration is needed. Either Network Activate this or use it on a single site.

You can also fine-tune each page's SEO, these options can be found beneath the content on the post's edit page.

***How it works***

**Description/og:description**

1. Autodescription first looks for any Genesis SEO content.
1. If not found, it will look through your page content.
1. Then it will strip all shortcodes and HTML.
1. From there it will make a sentence of maximum 160 characters and strips all words exceeding it.
1. It will add ... if it exceeds.

1. You can also add your own description on each page or post.
2. This will override the automatically generated description.

**og:image**

1. AutoDescription will look for a header image if set

**og:locale**

1. AutoDescription will look for the current blog's language settings

**og:type**

1. If the page is a blog post, it will output "article"
1. If it's an author page, it will output "profile"
1. If it's any other page, it will output "website"

**og:title**

1. On the front page it will add "blogname - blog description"
1. On any other page it will add: "page title - blogname"

1. You can also add your own description on each page or post.
2. This will override the automatically generated title.

**og:url**

1. The current url of the page

**og:site_name**

1. The blogname

**LD+JSON**

1. This will create a script in the header and Google will try to use this to allow users to further search in your website from their search engine.

**Canonical**

1. This will tell search engines where to look and continue from there. This value can be adjusted and works perfectly with [Domain Mapping by WPMUdev].

[Domain Mapping by WPMUdev]: https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/
	"Get Domain Mapping"

**Robots**

1. Set the nofollow, noindex and noarchive tags per page or post
1. It's up to the search engine to honor these

= Caching =

This plugin can be heavy on large pages (with book-like content). Therefor *a caching plugin is adviced*.
This plugin will not output anything if no object caching plugin is found and the user is logged in.

This plugin will always output the meta data when the user isn't logged in. Because Google is never logged in, your SEO is always correct.

**If you use object caching**

The output will be stored for each page, if you've edited a page the meta will stay the same until the object cache expires. So be sure to clear your object cache if it's a drastic change.

**Other notes**

*This plugin fully supports Genesis themes and WPMUdev's Domain Mapping, this plugin takes the Genesis SEO content under each post and page and the global Genesis SEO configuration page into account.*
*This plugin will work with any theme, however it will not look through Widgets or shortcodes for description. This means that one-page themes or pages built with page builders might leave an empty description.*
*To counter this issue, fill in the meta boxes beneath each post or page edit screen's content.*

== Installation ==

1. Install AutoDescription either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it! 
1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the meta boxes beneath the content.
