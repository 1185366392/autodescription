== Description ==

= AutoDescription =

**The all in one SEO optimization plugin for WordPress**

This plugin makes sure your site uses a correct Title, Description, Open Graph, LD+JSON, robots and a Canonical tag.

No configuration is needed. Either Network Activate this or use it on a single site.

> <strong>Written for MultiSite</strong><br>
> This plugin has been written for WordPress Multisite with a WordPress.com like environment in mind.
> 
> This means that this plugin is fully compatible with the [Domain Mapping plugin by WPMUdev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/)
> This also means that it's completely nailed down for security and best of all: ad-free.
> 
> It takes a lot of time to pin down every aspect of SEO optimization so expect this plugin to be updated regularly with new features.

You can also fine-tune each page's SEO, these options can be found beneath the content on the post's edit page.

= Caching =

This plugin can be heavy on large pages (with book-like content). Therefor *a caching plugin is adviced*.
This plugin will not output anything if no object caching plugin is found and the user is logged in.

**This plugin will always output the meta data when the user isn't logged in. Because Google is never logged in, your SEO meta output is always displayed correctly.**

**If you use object caching**

The output will be stored for each page, if you've edited a page the meta will stay the same until the object cache expires. So be sure to clear your object cache if your object cache expire time is set extremely high.

**Other notes**

*This plugin copies data from the Genesis SEO meta, this means that when you use Genesis, you can easily upgrade to this plugin without editing each page!*

*The Automatic Description Generation will work with any installation. But it will exclude shortcodes. This means that if you use shortcodes or a page builder, be sure to enter your custom description!*
